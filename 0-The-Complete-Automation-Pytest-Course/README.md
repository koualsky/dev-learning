# Types of tests
We can store all these tests in different dirs in project.



1. Unit Test
Test small piece of code like class or function.



2. Integration Test
Tests a larger bit of the code, maybe several classes or a subsystem.



3. E2E Test (End To End, System Test)
The most coplex way of testig.
For example we can test android system and I had to pretend to use this like real user in real world.



4. Functional Test
Test a single bit of functionality of a system.
For example: test that checks how well we add or delete or update a task item in tasks.



5. Subcutaneous Test
? ...probably don't worry about it ;)
